# Study: Econometrics Replication Example — DiD
# Task: 2.1 — Main DiD regression (two-way FE)
# Identification: [quasi-experimental: DiD]
# Assumption: parallel trends in the absence of the job-training program

# Analyst: Claude Code
# _fixture: synthetic — randomly generated DiD demo data, not real survey microdata.
