# Example: Econometrics Replication (DiD)

This example walks through all 7 stages of the Research Agent Harness using a synthetic difference-in-differences dataset. The study examines whether a regional job-training program increased household income.

All data is synthetic. The numbers are not meaningful.

---

## Research Design

- **Design:** Staggered difference-in-differences
- **Treatment:** Regional job-training program rollout (varies by region and year)
- **Outcome:** Household annual income
- **Identification:** `[quasi-experimental: DiD]` — parallel trends assumption
- **Data:** Two files requiring a merge (panel outcomes + policy timing)

## Quickstart

```bash
/research-harness-setup
/research-harness-audit
/research-harness-clean
/research-harness-plan
/research-harness-work 1.1
/research-harness-work 2.1
/research-harness-work 3.1
/research-harness-review
/research-harness-release
```

---

## What to notice about the merge

- `panel_outcomes.csv` has one row per household × year (hhid, year, income_annual, region)
- `policy_timing.csv` has one row per region × year with a treatment indicator
- The merge is `m:1`: many household-year observations per region-year treatment value
- The merge report will show: 600 rows in panel × 20 rows in policy → 600 rows post-merge, 100% match rate
- After merge, derive `treated = (policy_active == 1)` and `post = (year >= treat_year)`

---

## What to notice about the DiD review

- The review will check that the identification tag `[quasi-experimental: DiD]` appears in the script header
- The review will check that a pre-trend test task exists in `analysis_plan.md`
- The review will verify that all coefficients in the output table appear in the log file
- Any claim of "causal effect" without the DiD tag will be flagged as a major finding
